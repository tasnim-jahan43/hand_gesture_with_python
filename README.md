Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures
I built a Python-based virtual mouse system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, allowing users to control their computer with hand gestures detected via webcam. The project enables real-time cursor movement, clicking, scrolling, and even browser navigation, using only finger positions â€” offering a touchless and intuitive human-computer interaction experience.

 Key Features:
Hand landmark detection with MediaPipe
Gesture-based actions: move, click, scroll, and navigate
Real-time responsiveness and intuitive interface
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI

Feature	Gesture
Move Mouse	: 1 finger (index)

Click	: 2 fingers (index + middle)

Scroll	: 3 fingers

Do Nothing :	4 fingers
